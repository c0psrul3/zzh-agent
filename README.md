# zzh-agent
OMZ Plugin for ssh-agent handling
=================================

I've been working on this for a while and seems to work well on my system.
That is, its current state is 'wfm' / Alpha.

Support / Suggestions / Help would be appreciated.



On to How-To noise!
-------------------

The "init.sh" script can be sourced from .bashrc, or the entire project dir
can be placed in your .omz-custom/plugins/  directory.
